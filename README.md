## User Stories 
### Who are your users, what do they want, and why?
>IGENIO, Ideas Generator is a platform that allows users to find and generate ideas. The app will englobe popular topics and current events; ranging from tech, fashion, travel, business, food, ect. Users will be anyone who is looking for ideas in a particular topic. They will create an account through the app, or login using their other social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook) Once the account is created, the user will have a profile which contains some information about them. (name, email, location and bio) Through the app the user will be able to search for ideas based on topics, (hopefully post MVP: location using Google’s API). Users will be able to create, update or delete an idea. Through our usage of the Twitter API, the user can also store an idea from the internet to their Igenio account. It’ll help keep them organized through the execution of the idea.
